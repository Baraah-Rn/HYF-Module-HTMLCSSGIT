1-How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

I Used the mkdir command to create a new folder. To make that folder hidden,I added a dot (.) before the name of the folder
I Used the touch command to create a new file. To make that file hidden,I added a dot (.) before the name of the file

dir-a

2-How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

Click the Windows Start button from the taskbar and open bash then change to the path that I want,
or open Git bash Here in the directory that I want then write the command :

mkdir -p test1/test2/test3


3-How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

I used the command :
echo "Hello" > test.txt       // "Line1" > the name of the file I want to write in it
echo "You" >> test.txt         // "Line2" >> the name of the file I want to write in it
